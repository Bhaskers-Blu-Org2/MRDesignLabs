# Mixed Reality Design Labs
This repo is where Microsoft's Windows Mixed Reality Design team publishes examples and explorations. The goal is to inspire creators and help them to build Mixed Reality experiences. We share sample app projects here that demonstrate how to use various types of common controls and patterns in Mixed Reality. If you are looking for official toolkit, please use **[Mixed Reality Toolkit](https://github.com/Microsoft/MixedRealityToolkit-Unity)**

|Lunar Module demonstrates how to extend Hololens' base gestures with two hand tracking and xbox controller input, reactive objects to surface mapping and plane finding, and simple menu systems. You can use this project's components to create your own mixed reality app experience. |Periodic Table of the Elements app demonstrates how to use Object Collection to lay out an array of objects in three-dimensional space with various surface types. You can also find the example of using Fluent Design elements such as light, depth, motion and material.|
